# Molecule-Generation-using-Graph-NN
Generating molecules using Graph Neural Networks trained on the QM9- Quantum Mechanics dataset.

Trained three types of molecule properties:
1. Molecule Linker
2. Bond classifier
3. Node and edge generator

# Requirements
To run the code, you will need a python>2.6 (Note: python 3.7 worked for us) distribution with the following python packages:
Tensorflow
Numpy
Scipy
Matplotlib
Networkx
We used the following package versions:
numpy==1.19.2
scipy==1.5.2
matplotlib==3.3.2
networkx==2.5
tensorflow==1.14.0
